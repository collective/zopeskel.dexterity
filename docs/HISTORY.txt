Changelog
=========

zopeskel.dexterity should be regarded as a compatability/maintenance branch of
the Dexterity templates for use with ZopeSkel <= 3.0dev. All future feature
development is taking place in templer.dexterity (also in the collective).

1.5.2 ~ (2013-06-02)
--------------------

* Use plone.directives.form.model.schema for grok'd Schema.
  [smcmahon]

1.5.1 ~ (2013-05-29)
--------------------

* Offer no-grok option in initial product creation questions.
  [smcmahon]

* Remove deprecated relations extra.
  [smcmahon]

1.5.0 ~ (2013-04-09)
--------------------

* Backport rudimentary content type tests from templer.dexterity.
  [smcmahon]

* Dexterity 2 is deemphasizing the Item type in favor of containers which
  may or may not allow contents. Adjusted question and actions to match.
  [smcmahon]

* grok no longer has automatic "static" resource directory. Wire in a new
  one with zcml. Name it "resources" to distinguish it from the old grok
  magic. Document in its own readme.
  [smcmahon]

* Cover Plone 4.3 dependencies. Add "[grok, relations]" to plone.app.dexterity
  dependencies.
  [smcmahon]

1.4.1 ~ 2012-12-29
------------------

* Fixed issue with ZopeSkel 3.x series, for moment, it is pinning
  version 'ZopeSkel<=2.21.2' as a dependency requirement for install.

1.4 ~ 2011-10-29
----------------

- Minor revisions to bring into closer accord with PP4 and current
  Dexterity Developers' Manual.
  [smcmahon]

- Add blob support
  [smcmahon]

1.3 ~ 2011-05-22
----------------

- Added README.txt to static folder in dexterity template.
  [smcmahon]


- Changed metadata.xml template to start with an integer of 1 rather than
  the package version number.
  [davidjb]


1.3b3 ~ 2011-05-13
------------------

- Add a working sample integration doctest.
  [smcmahon]

1.3b2 ~ 2011-05-13
------------------

- Restore dotted filenames for new content types. Content types in file
  system addons need to be robustly installable in systems that may already
  have simple add-on names.
  [smcmahon]

1.3b1 ~ 2011-05-07
------------------

- Removed content field and view local command templates. My rationale for
  removing the field template is that most novice developers should be using
  TTW models and taking advantage of supermodel round-tripping. Those who are
  comfortable with schema fields are probably not likely to be using a tool
  like ZopeSkel to add them. The rationale for removing the view template is
  simpler: it's main functionality is now in the content-type template.
  [smcmahon]

- Add sample view definition with addition of a content type.
  [smcmahon]

- Revise to use filenames that will match those created by dexterity's export
  buttons. This means removing the dotted filename style.
  [smcmahon]

- Revise to use grok-style directory structures that will more closely
  correspond with the dexterity docs.
  [smcmahon]

1.2.2 ~ 2011-04-18
-------------------

- Fixed issues when locales folder was lost in the packaging and thus was not
  able to start Plone 4.1 with the generated product present. Packaging
  probably prunes empty folders, included a dummy README.txt file there.
  [mikko ohtamaa]

1.2.1 ~ 2011-04-08
------------------

- Release 1.2 of zopeskel.dexterity is not installable with python2.4
  due to a bug in the tarfile module.  Added setup.cfg that forces
  using the --formats=zip option when creating an sdist; this solves
  the problem on python2.4.
  [maurits]


1.2 ~ 2011-01-13
----------------

- dexterity_behavior_field localcommand now also adds the relevant
  setter/getter/deleter in the adapter.
  [kagesenshi]

1.2.1 ~ unreleased
------------------

- Release 1.2 of zopeskel.dexterity is not installable with python2.4
  due to a bug in the tarfile module.  Added setup.cfg that forces
  using the --formats=zip option when creating an sdist; this solves
  the problem on python2.4.
  [maurits]


1.2 ~ 2011-01-13
----------------

- dexterity_behavior_field localcommand now also adds the relevant
  setter/getter/deleter in the adapter.
  [kagesenshi]


1.1b2 ~ 2010-11-23
------------------

* Fixed indentation in the module generated by dexterity_behavior local
  command. It was using 3 spaces instead of 4 spaces.
  [esartor]

* Added import for the i18n message factory to the dexterity_behavior local
  command.
  [esartor]


1.1b1 ~ 2010-06-21
------------------

* Correcting date type fields to use schema.Date rather than schema.Datetime.
  Using Datetime caused an incorrect widget being used, leading to
  issues in KSS validation and not being able to save content.
  [davidjb]

* Updating collective.z3cform.datetimewidget widgets locations.  The old
  locations are now deprecated.
  [davidjb]

* Wrapped Dexterity content title/description fields in MessageFactory call
  [davidjb]

* Added note about Paster and potentially missing eggs to readme
  [davidjb]

1.1a1
-----

* added ability to add fields to the content type and behavior schema
  [vangheem]

* moved to zopeskel.dexterity package from collective.dexteritypaste
  [vangheem]

1.0a1dev
