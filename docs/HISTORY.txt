Changelog
=========

1.2.1 ~ 2011-04-08
------------------

- Release 1.2 of zopeskel.dexterity is not installable with python2.4
  due to a bug in the tarfile module.  Added setup.cfg that forces
  using the --formats=zip option when creating an sdist; this solves
  the problem on python2.4.

----------------

  setter/getter/deleter in the adapter.

  command. It was using 3 spaces instead of 4 spaces.

  command.

1.1b1 ~ 2010-06-21
------------------

* Correcting date type fields to use schema.Date rather than schema.Datetime.
  Using Datetime caused an incorrect widget being used, leading to
  issues in KSS validation and not being able to save content.

* Updating collective.z3cform.datetimewidget widgets locations.  The old 
  locations are now deprecated.
